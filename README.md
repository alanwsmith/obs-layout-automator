# OBS Position Sources Script

## Overview

This is the python script I use to make it
easier to position sources in OBS scenes
by doing it programmatically.

## Goals

- YAML file for configuration
- Configure all scenes and sources from
  a single file
- Adjust position, sizing, and crops

## Python Install

Python needs to be installed. Then,
for my Windows machine I went to:

```
OBS -> Tools -> Scripts -> Python Settings
```

From there, I browsed for the folder that holds
Python. For me, that was:

```
C:/Users/alan/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Pypthon310
```

TODO: Point to article on 3.6-3.10 working but not
3.11. Since 3.6 is deprecated, I installed 3.10

## Installing toml

I had to install a toml module. I did this from the
command line with:

```
python -m pip install toml
```

## Loading The Script

TKTKTK - TONOTE: As soon as you load the script the interface
shows up.

## Config File
